# CS50 TSE Querier

### Querier Basic idea

This [querier](../querier) directory implements functionality for the TSE querier.

This Indexer expects the following commandline arguments:

1. A valid page directory containing files generated by a search engine Crawler, like the one implemented in the [crawler](../crawler/README.md) directory.

2. An index file name such as one generated by the [indexer](../indexer/README.md). The file **MUST** exist and be available for reading.

***

### Functionality

The [querier](./querier.c) loads the index then polls it for matches to a use's queries.

***

### Usage

All build operations are implemented in the [Makefile](./Makefile).

* To build, run `make`.

* To clean up, run `make clean`.

* To test the querier module, run `make test`. Output from previous tests is available in the [testing.out](./testing.out) file, generated from [testing.sh](./testing.sh).

* To test memory usage of the indexer, run `make memtest`. Output from previous tests is available in the [memcheck.out](./memcheck.out) file, generated from [memcheck.sh](./memcheck.sh).
* To run a quick sample test with your own queries, run `make quicktest`.

Note: the testing scripts anticipate the existence of a `../data/output/[FOLDER]` location where `[FOLDER]` is a folder named in the fashion `seedURL-maxDepth` (for example, `letters-0`, `letters-10`, `wikipedia-1`, etc.).

**These folders and their contents can be generated by a call to `make test` in the [indexer](../indexer) directory, which in turn `make test`s the [crawler](../crawler) directory.
The testing script (querier `make test` target) automatically checks for existence of necessary index files and calls make in the other directories if needed.**
