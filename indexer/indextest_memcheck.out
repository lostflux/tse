DISCLAIMER: The functionality of this testing script is dependent on
the existence of the following directories in the directory ../data/output 
1. letters-0
2. letters-10
3. toscrape-0
4. toscrape-1
5. wikipedia-0
6. wikipedia-1

To generate these directories and their contents, run `make test`, 
which tests the indexer and builds the needed files.

This script reads created "[...].index" files from ..data/output, 
rebuilds them into index_t objects using the indextest module defined in indextest.c,
and writes them back into "...-rebuild.index" files in ../data/output.

It then runs the comparator function in ~/cs50-dev/shared/tse/indexcmp,
which compares the original and rebuild files and checks for discrepancies.
